# HUI-to-Mackie-Control-Wrapper
This is a Max/MSP patch which allows you to use a Mackie Baby HUI with Ableton Live

## This is not finished
So far all I currently have working is the transport control and the Mix/Edit view switcher.
The channel strips do not work.

## What's the point?
In my studio I have a MackieControl Universal as my main interface. I picked up a Mackie Baby HUI cheap since the owner didn't know if it was working or not.
I decided to use it mainly for the transport control. This way when I'm in my live room I can hit record without being in the control room.
